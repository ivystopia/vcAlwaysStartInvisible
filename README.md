# vcAlwaysStartInvisible

Tired of getting bombarded with messages the moment you appear online?

Want to lurk a bit before showing yourself?

With this plugin, every time you close Discord, your status will be set to Invisible.  
The next time you open Discord, you'll still be Invisible, so you decide when to go online.

## Installation

1. Place the `vcAlwaysStartInvisible` directory in the `userPlugins` directory.
2. Run `pnpm build` from the root Vencord directory.
